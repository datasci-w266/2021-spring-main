    "Here we'll explore a few basic concepts from [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory) that are particularly relevant for this course. Information theory is a fairly broad subject, founded in the 1940s by [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon), that gives a mathematical foundation for quantifying the communication of information. Shannon's original paper included, for example, the idea of the [bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit), the minimal unit of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turned out that an information theoretic perspective is particularly convenient for understanding machine learning. So let's review the following concepts, which will appear throughout the course:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mutual Information\n",
    "* Entropy\n",
    "* Cross-Entropy\n",
    "* KL Divergence\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have encountered several of these concepts in machine learning classes you've taken.  For similar reasons, they are important in NLP. We'll discuss them throughout the semester as they appear, but it is worth quickly going through the definitions once up front so they are fresh in your mind!\n",

    "[Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_mutual_information) is a measure of how much knowing one outcome tells you about another.\n",

Applied to language, if you mention the word \"rain\", I learn that you're more likely to also say \"wet\" or \"umbrella\" in the same context.\n",

    "[Entropy (Shannon entropy)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_entropy) is a notion of how \"uncertain\" the outcome of some experiment is.  The more uncertain - or the more spread out the distribution - the higher the entropy. *(Aside: some of you may have encountered \"entropy\" in a thermodynamics class.

Loop over each event and take the product of the probability of that event and the base-2 log of the probability.

Similarly, \"entropy\" is the average bits we need if we design with the right distribution in mind.\n",

That difference is known as the [Kullback–Leibler divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence), or KL divergence for short.\n",

In general, the cross-entropy loss - and prediction accuracy - will not be zero, but will be equal to the entropy $H(P)$.

This is different from the one-hot encoding we use for training labels, which are _observations_ (single values) _sampled_ from some true distribution $y_i^\\text{obs} \\sim P(y\\ |\\ x_i)$. In that case, one-hot encoding is just a convenient shortcut. In general - and particularly in NLP - we'll have some label uncertainty, and the true distribution $P(y\\ |\\ x_i)$ will be spread among potentially many possibilities.\n",

    "One final observation:  cross-entropy is not symmetric (think about how $P$ and $Q$ appear in the formula to understand why).  As a result KL Divergence isn't symmetric either (if you want to prove this to yourself substitute in for CE and E in the equation above and simplify).  So while KL divergence is a measure of similarity, it's useful to keep in mind that $D_{KL}(P\\ ||\\ Q) \\ne D_{KL}(Q\\ ||\\ P)$."
