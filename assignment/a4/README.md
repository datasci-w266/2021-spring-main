# Assignment 4: Text Classification & Deep Learning

This assignment consists of the following:
* [Prelude](Prelude.ipynb), introducing basic text processing for ML. No work,
  but you'll need this information for the rest of the assignment so read it carefully!
* [Exploration](Exploration.ipynb), in which we'll introduce the Stanford 
  Sentiment Treebank (SST) and train a baseline Naive Bayes model.
  Bag-of-Words model on the SST.
* [Convolutional Neural Networks](CNN.ipynb), in which you'll explore a convolutional neural network

You may want to review [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html), which we'll be using to manage the datasets.

## Submission Instructions

As with Assignment 1, please submit by running the submit script, only with `-a 4` (since this is assignment 4).
```
./assignment/submit.sh -u your-github-username -a 4
```

It is your responsibility to check that your work has made it to your GitHub repository in the `a4-submit` branch.  As always, a small number of points will be deducted in each assignment for submitting in the wrong place.
