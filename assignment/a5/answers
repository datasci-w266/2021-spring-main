# | Section (1): Preliminaries (unrelated to a notebook) (17 points)  | 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

# Question 1 (/1): What is the goal of a language model?
# (This question is multiple choice.  Delete all but the correct answer).
language_models_1_1: 
 - Translate between languages.
 - Score whether a sequence of tokens belongs to a language.
 - Model sentiment of a sentence.

# Question 2 (/1): If you don't have much training data, what might happen if you increase "n" of n-grams?
# (This question is multiple choice.  Delete all but the correct answer).
language_models_1_2: 
 - Model performance will decrease despite increased sparsity
 - Model performance will improve despite increased sparsity

# Question 3 (/1): If you have lots of training data, what might happen if you increase "n" of n-grams?
# (This question is multiple choice.  Delete all but the correct answer).
language_models_1_3: 
 - Model performance will decrease despite increased sparsity
 - Model performance will improve despite increased sparsity

# Question 4 (/2): A reasonable technique to handle out-of-vocabulary words?
# (This question is multiple choice.  Delete all but the correct answer).
language_models_1_4: 
 - Replacing digits with a special token
 - Replacing rare words in the training set with a special UNK token to get estimates for what contexts these tend to appear in
 - All of the above

# Question 5 (/2): Smoothing is a technique to... (hint - remember P(next_word | context) must add up to 1 across all next_word-s.
# (This question is multiple choice.  Delete all but the correct answer).
language_models_1_5: 
 - Handle sparsity issues even while increasing the amount of context considered
 - Take the probability distribution of words that appear in a context in the training set and flatten / smooth it by taking probability from very high probability words and spreading it across the rest of the vocabulary
 - All of the above

# Question 6 (/5): Let C[x, y, z] be the number of times the text "x y z" appeared in the corpus.  C[the cat] = 8000, C[the cat in] = 5000, C[the cat in the] = 1000 and C[the cat in the hat] = 800.  The size of your vocabulary is 10,000.  What is P(hat | the cat in the)?
language_models_1_6: 0.00000

# Question 7 (/5): Let C[x, y, z] be the number of times the text "x y z" appeared in the corpus.  C[the cat] = 8000, C[the cat in] = 5000, C[the cat in the] = 1000 and C[the cat in the hat] = 800.  The size of your vocabulary is 10,000.  What is P(hat | the cat in the) if you use "AddK smoothing" with k=5?
language_models_1_7: 0.00000
