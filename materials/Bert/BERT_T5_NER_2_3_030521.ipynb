    "In this notebook we investigate how we can leverage **BERT** (see [\"BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf), by Devlin/Chang/Lee/Toutanova, Google AI Language) for the problem of Named Entity Recognition (NER). Their paper actually contains the NER use case as a fine-tuning example, but we are not striving to replicate necessarily exactly their approach but build the model in the most approachable and 'naive' way, i.e. simply applying a straightforward model that follows intuitively the BERT mantra leveraging its context-based embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at the effect of also fine-tuning BERT layers vs just adding and training classification layers on top of the BERT model and find that in this cursory and certainly incomplete study the re-training of BERT layers does offer some advantages. We also perform a test reducing the training data by 90% and find that the results are still quite decent, re-emphasizing BERT's usefulness in situations where the data set is on the small side. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Update:** In the appendix, we also recast the NER problem as a 'translation problem', allowing us to also get some practice with **T5** [\"Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf) , by C. Raffel et al. (Note that one likely would expect less favorable results for the specific NER problem, but the introduction of T5 is the purpose, not the actual result.)\n",

    "\n",
    "### I. Introduction & Strategy <a id=\"intro\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT and other context-aware embedding frameworks like [ELMO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365), OpenAI's [GPT-2](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf), and [XLNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08237.pdf), etc.  -  provide extremely useful basis for many NLP tasks. A key reason why these frameworks are so useful is that they allow us to use the power of extensive pre-training that was done on a (set of) large corpus/era. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, their ability to encode deep contextual relationships between words (and sentences or sentence segments) derived from a generic set of tasks provides us with the context-specific embeddings.  Depending on the task, we can then simply add a couple of classification layers with a modest number of weights to fine-tune the combined model to our very specific NLP task that may not have the luxury of a very large labeled data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous and very good resources available on the web for various of these tasks (Movie Reviews, Sentiment  Analysis, etc,.). In this notebook, we want to consider the task of Named Entity Recognition, as it features a number of useful complexities that are good to discuss:\n",
    "\n",
    "* token-level vs. sentence-level BERT output, which seems to be less-often discussed \n",
    "* potential one-to-many split of word-to-token by the tokenizer (what are we going to do for the labels?) \n",
    "* potentially a need for custom loss and accuracy definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, we will follow the original BERT paper in its approach to NER:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"BERT_NER_Devlin_et_al.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "<center>Image Source: \"BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding\"</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each word will need to be tokenized. We will then, sentence-by-sentence, feed in the tokenized text into BERT, resulting in our case (we are using the BERT's base model) in a 768-dimensional output vector for each input token (and other tokens that BERT wants us to add). We then simply add a fully-connected hidden layer and finally a classification of suitable dimension that will take each token-output and make a decision on its NER label.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very intuitive. However, a few obvious questions arise that we want to look at in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) How do we need to pre-process the data set to be suitable for BERT?   \n",
    "3) How can we build the model in Keras?   \n",
    "4) How can we incorporate custom loss functions and accuracy calculations?   \n",
    "5) What does fine-tuning mean? Is it just adding and training new layer(s), or do I re-train BERT layers as well?   \n",
    "6) Do I need to worry about customizing the optimizer?  \n",
    "\n",
    "These and other questions we hope to be able to shed some light on. The dataset we will be using is the \"**Annotated Corpus for Named Entity Recognition using GMB [Groningen Meaning Bank]**\", which is shared on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/abhinavwalia95/entity-annotated-corpus). It contains sentences with 1m+ words, conveniently annotated with POS and NER tags. \n",
    "\n",
    "### I.2. Problem Definition & Metrics <a id=\"problem\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task will obviously be to properly identify the NER tags. There are potentially two things to consider when we want to define our success metrics: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) If we send the data sentence-by-sentence, we will need to apply padding to ensure consistent length. This will create 'new' labels that we will call 'nerPad'. Also, words can be split into multiple tokens, requiring us to add filler labels, which we will denote 'nerX'.  (There are multiple ways to address this, but this is what we are choosing here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we do that, should we look at accuracy over all tokens? Probably not. So our **first metric will be: accuracy for tokens which were part of the original text (and only the first token if a word is split)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) As we know from NER problems, most tokens will be 'Other'. So we may get already a pretty decent baseline result by always predicting 'Other'. In situations like that it may be useful to also look at **our second metric: the accuracy for all original tokens that are not 'Other'**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### I.3. Notebook Strategy <a id=\"strategy\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The outline that we will follow in this notebook is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Process the text**\n",
    "* re-assemble words into sentences. (The corpus is of the form one-line-one-word, with sentence markers.)\n",
    "* tokenize the sentences with the BERT Tokenizer\n",
    "* create the input ids required for BERT:\n",
    "   * **sentence_ids** [the list of token ids for each sentence]\n",
    "   * **mask_ids** [the specification whether a specific token should be masked out (we mask out '[PAD]' tokens)]\n",
    "   * **sequence_ids** [used to denote whether a token is part of the first, second, or other segment in each input example. For us, this will always be '0'.]\n",
    "* prepare the labels  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some complications can include:\n",
    "- some words may not be in vocab\n",
    "- words can get split into multiple tokens. What are the labels?\n",
    "- Sentences do not all have the same length. Padding!\n",
    "- usual formatting details, like \"10,000\" and \"\"\" for quotes in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Analyze and prepare the data**\n",
    "* Identify balance/imbalance situation\n",
    "* Estimate baseline accuracy defined by 'always picking the most common token'\n",
    "* Split into training and test set\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Build the model**\n",
    "* Build BERT layer\n",
    "* Add classification layer(s)\n",
    "* Define custom loss functions and metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**4) Run a few experiments**\n",
    "* Allow for re-training of a few BERT layers\n",
    "* Investigate the confusion matrix\n",
    "* Compare results with the model without re-training BERT layers\n",
    "* Test how good the results would be if you only at 10% of the training data (~4k sentences) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Appendix: Try the NER task witgh T5**\n",
    "* Re-phrase NER problem as a translation problem (maybe not natural... but why not?) \n",
    "* Create training/test data\n",
    "* Run a test  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook leverages BERT and T5 implementations from Hugging Face.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook was run with **Tensorflow 2.3** and **Transformers 4.0.0**, leveraging one GPU with 4 GB of memory. (Note that I ran out of GPU memory a couple of times and restarted appropriately. But other than that with the given versions the notebook should execute end-to-end.)\n",
